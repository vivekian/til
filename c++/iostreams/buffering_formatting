formatting is the task of taking a bunch of strongly typed data values from a program and translating them to "text". e.g. the number 42 is printed as "0x2A". 
buffering is the task of taking raw bytes and sending them to an output device. e.g. on a disk or memory or a network socket. 

in most cases text characters are bytes, but in some Operating Systems, this can be different where its possible two bytes may represent a single new line etc.
